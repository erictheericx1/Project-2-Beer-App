As a beginning beer drinker, I want to better accustom myself so I can decide if drinking beer is for me.
I prefer wine, my husband likes beer. I want to get to know more about it so I can surprise him and we can enjoy a beverage together without fighting about choice of drink.
As a verteren beer drinker, I don't know much about what I drink. I also just drink one kind of beer. I want to expand my horizons and see what else is out there
